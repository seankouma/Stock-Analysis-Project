# Stock-Analysis-Project

New project - Late Nov 2020

 A project with two primary goals:
 #1 Perform basic API calls to the Alpha Vantage API to get stock prices and then do some analysis on the stock (such as calculating simple moving averages and standard deviation from starting stock price).
 
 #2 Increase the complexity of stock analysis and start doing predictions. I'm currently leaving this pretty open ended as I haven't quite decided what I want to start with.
 
 For the project, I also found an incredibly useful wrapper for using Alpha Vantage's API. The wrapper can be found here: https://github.com/RomelTorres/alpha_vantage
